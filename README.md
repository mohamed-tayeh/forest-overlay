# Forest Overlay

This is the forest overlay that I use for my co-working Twitch stream and thought I would share.

# Installation
1. Download the zip to your desired location

# Configuration
Within the folder, find and open the file called `configs.js` using `notepad`

The file should look like this with comments on how to change the default configurations:

Channel: channel for which to connect the bot to
username: username of the bot you which to have connected to this overlay, e.g. I have a separate bot called `moh_manager` for my channel that is connected to all the overlays.

For oauth do the following steps:
1. Log In to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
2. Copy the token
3. Paste into configs 

oauth is a token that acts like a password that only allows the overlay to send messages on behalf of that account.
